 I was very tired and no strength left to walk further but my friend Mr Sangha was quite ready and I had to join.  One old forester John was acquitted with the place and only he could have led the location in that dense forest. he led the way and to my surprise there was not any track etc.. only thick forest with all wet muddy path and all kind of hurdle in walking. .John was ahead cutting all wood and branches coming in the way and making some temporary passage for us to follow. . Most of the time it was raining. .we had to walk for an hour to reach the expected destination.. it was quite dehydrating and we forgot to bring any water.. the humidity above 100  and all my towels and clothing were wet due to sweating. . we couldn't manage to click pictures but he was whole night around us.. manage some recording for the first time ..
